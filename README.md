## ⌛ History of creating the project (Challenges faced) ⌛
### _Docker and Liquibase_
After deploying my application using Docker, I found that my new liquibase scripts were no longer working, which prevented me from expanding my local database further. 
To solve this problem, I asked my mentor for help, and together we found a solution. 
I created a separate application-local.properties file where I set spring.docker.compose.enabled=false and ran my application locally from there, which helped me fix the problem.
### _JpaRepository_
While testing the controller for the order, I found out that I was getting a Lazy Initialization exception on one of the endpoints (every programmer has probably experienced this). 
However, I was able to handle this exception by writing a native query on one of the OrderRepository methods.

## 💹 Possible improvements 💹
In the future I plan to add
ratings for books and the ability to rate them. And I also plan to add a system of discounts for books. 
These two features will help to increase book sales, as it is important for a beginner to find an interesting book, 
and for experienced readers, there will be more incentive to buy a book through discounts.
