## üê≥ Running with Docker Compose üê≥
If you prefer to run the Bookstore application in a Docker container using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Clone repository: Clone the repository from the console with the command: `git clone https://github.com/AgroFix/book-store.git`

2. Check Docker Compose file: Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the project is configured appropriately. You can customize environment variables, ports, and other settings in this file.

## ‚åõ History of creating the project (Challenges faced) ‚åõ
### _Docker and Liquibase_
After deploying my application using Docker, I found that my new liquibase scripts were no longer working, which prevented me from expanding my local database further.
To solve this problem, I asked my mentor for help, and together we found a solution.
I created a separate application-local.properties file where I set spring.docker.compose.enabled=false and ran my application locally from there, which helped me fix the problem.
### _JpaRepository_
While testing the controller for the order, I found out that I was getting a Lazy Initialization exception on one of the endpoints (every programmer has probably experienced this).
However, I was able to handle this exception by writing a native query on one of the OrderRepository methods.
___
## üíπ Possible improvements üíπ
In the future I plan to add
ratings for books and the ability to rate them. And I also plan to add a system of discounts for books.
These two features will help to increase book sales, as it is important for a beginner to find an interesting book,
and for experienced readers, there will be more incentive to buy a book through discounts.
